    "Developing models means dealing with:  \n",
    "1. Simple and multiple linear regression\n",
    "2. Model evaluation using visualization\n",
    "3. Polynomial regression and pipelines\n",
    "4. R-squared and MSE for in-sample evaluation\n",
    "5. Prediction and decision making  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you can answer decisive questions like, \"how can you deetermine  \n",
    "a fair value for a used car?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "A model can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a value  \n",
    "given one or more other values. They relate **one or more independent variable  \n",
    "to dependent variables**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the more **relevant data** you have, the more accurate your model is.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - You enter the following to your model:  \n",
    "      - `highway-mpg`  \n",
    "      - `curb-weight`  \n",
    "      - `engine-size`  \n",
    "\n",
    "And you should receive an accurate prediction for `price`.  \n",
